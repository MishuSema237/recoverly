# Why Balances Show $0 (Balance System Explanation)

## Understanding Tesla Capital Balances

When a new user account is created, all balances start at **$0**. This is **normal and expected behavior**.

### Balance Increases When:

1. **User Makes a Deposit**
   - Admin approves a deposit request
   - Amount is added to Main Balance
   - Example: Deposit $1000 → Main Balance becomes $1000

2. **Daily Gains Are Credited**
   - When a user has an active investment
   - Daily returns are calculated and added to Main Balance
   - Example: Investment earns 2% daily → Gains added to balance

3. **Referral Bonuses**
   - When someone signs up using the user's referral code
   - Bonus is added to Referral Balance (then moves to Main Balance when they verify email)
   - Example: Someone signs up with your code → $10 referral bonus

4. **Making an Investment**
   - Funds move from Main Balance to Investment Balance
   - Example: Invest $500 → Main Balance decreases, Investment Balance increases

### Why The Balances Are Currently $0:

Looking at the account details:
- **Account Created:** 10/12/2025
- **Activity Log:** Only "Account Created" entry
- **No deposits made yet**
- **No investments made yet**  
- **No referral bonuses earned yet**

Therefore: **$0 balances are correct!** ✅
